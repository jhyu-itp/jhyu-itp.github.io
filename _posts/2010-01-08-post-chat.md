The baryon asymmetry of the universe is one of the phenomena beyond the standard model and can be explained by the electroweak baryogenesis. This scenario require the strongly first-order electroweak phase transition in order to realize the asymmetry. The model with extended Higgs sector can easily satisfy the condition. Also, if the phase transition occurs discontinuously, the gravitational wave can be produced by the phase transition and the spectrum of it depend on the form of the potential. Therefore, we may use not only collider experiments but also the gravitational observation experiments to test the new model. In this talk, we discuss wether we can complementarily test the extended Higgs model by the synergy between measurements of gravitational waves and Higgs couplings.
