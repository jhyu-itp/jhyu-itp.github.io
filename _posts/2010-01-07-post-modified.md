The discovery of the Higgs particle is an astonishing triumph of the Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics. Since its discovery, many precision measurements have been carried out at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to test its properties and its couplings to other particles. Among all the couplings of the Higgs boson, its self-couplings are the least known, which leaves the nature of the Higgs potential undetermined. Motivated by many new physics models, we systematically classify various types of Higgs potential, different from the Landau-Ginzburg type of the SM, such as the psuedo-Goldstone Higgs, Coleman-Weinberg Higgs and Tadpole-induced Higgs. We find that the precision measurement of the double Higgs boson production rate at the 27 TeV HE-LHC (high-energy LHC) can discriminate various Higgs potential scenarios, while it is necessary to measure the triple Higgs boson production at the future 100 TeV proton-proton collider in order to fully determine the shape of Higgs potential.
